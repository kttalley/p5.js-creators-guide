                Standing on the Shoulders of Giants
            </h1>
            <p>
                One of the most miraculous things about being human lies in the fact that we are able to teach and learn-- even from those who have lived long before us. Thanks to the miracle of the human brain, we are able to internalize knowledge that's shared and taught to us rather than having to rediscover something firsthand every time there's something new we must learn or do.

            <p>
                This is what it means to stand on the shoulders of giants. We as individuals are able to pick up where human history has left off -- and where it has left us is a very exciting time unlike any before it.

                Only a few decades ago, owning a personal computer was a privlige experienced by few. Now computer technologies are not only more accessible to more people, but computers offer an exponentially greater amount of access to information. The applications and software we have at our disposal today provide notonly convenience and entertainment, but an incredible wealth of educational experiences.

                What is a Programming Language?
            </h1> 

            <p>
                A programming language is a way of providing instructions to the computer. All programs, whether theyâ€™re a game like Minecraft and Zelda or applications like
calculators, Google Chrome or MicrosoftWord are written in some kind of programming language.

                What is JavaScript?
            </h1>
            
            <p>
                JavaScript is the most widely used programming language in the world. It is used to power nearly every website on the internet. JavaScript is not to be confused with Java, which is a different programming language altogether. Where most programming languages need to be compiled (IE. translated) into machine code locally on your device, JavaScript is interpreted line by line thanks to our web browsers.
