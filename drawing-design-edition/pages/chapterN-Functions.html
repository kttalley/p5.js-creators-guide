             If we can remember that JavaScript organizes data into different values, and that these values can be created and used simply by calling or binding it with a name, using billions of bits of data to our advantage sounds slightly less frightening. This is especially true once we understand the power of functions.
        </p>

        <p>
             Functions are values, much like numbers and words are values. Yet functions are a parcel of data that includes an instruction, or series of instructions, warpped inside a single name. By simply calling (typing) a function's name, we can begin a series of instructions, however few or many, which could be regarded as a mini program in its own rite.                    
        </p>

        <p>
           Let's consider the word function in it's most general term. What does it mean? If a 'malfunction' means something isn't working, then a function is something that is working! 'Functioning' is 'doing', and a function in programming is a specific series of coded instructions we can use as many times as we please.                  
         </p>

             Think back to the first shape you learned to draw to your canvas. To create a point on your screen, you had to call it's name followed by parenthesis: point(), and then provide an x and y coordinate inside its parenthesis. Thanks to some other awesome programmer who built the point function, we're able to call that function, provide the information it needs and it draws that shape to our canvas. The same is true for all the basic shape functions provided to us in Code Naturally. We don't even have to understand how those functions are  made. All we need to understand is how to use them.

              Any we look at it, a function is just a different type of value, a piece of data, that, from the outside, appears to be a single name. Yet within a function, massive amounts of instructions are potentially contained. As functions are just another value, another chunk of data like any other number or word, we can even reassign exisiting functions to different tiles. Or, better yet, we can build our very own functions.
